# MIPS --- Disassembler
Author - Swanand Mhalagi

This is a 32-bit MIPS binary disassembler.

This was my Computer Architecture Course Project developed in C/C++. Later I developed the same code for python just for fun.

1)	MIPS-CProgram.cpp --- C++ source file 

2)	Input --- text file already containing input.

3)	Output --- text file (Program creates this file if not available in the folder)             

Steps to run the project

1)	Open the source file MIPS-CProgram.cpp

2)	Run the code Or Compile and Run the code. 

3)	Now it will ask to enter the total number of binary inputs present in input.txt file

4)	For example in this file we have 18 binary input lines

5)  Open the text file output to check the results.
