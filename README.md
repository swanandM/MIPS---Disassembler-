# MIPS --- Disassembler
Author - Swanand Mhalagi
This is a 32-bit MIPS binary disassembler.

1)	MIPS-CProgram.cpp			C++ source file 
2)	Input					text file already containing input.
3)	Output 				text file (program creates this file if not available in the folder)             

Steps to run the project

1)	Open the source file MIPS-CProgram.cpp
2)	Run the code Or Compile and Run the code. 
3)	Now it will ask to enter the total number of binary inputs present in input.txt file
4)	For example in this file we have 18 binary input lines
5)	It will produce the screen shown below. Press Enter (Optional) 
6)	Open the text file output to check the results.
